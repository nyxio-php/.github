Async PHP **microframework** based on Open Swoole.

### PHP 8.1 support 😎
A lot of [Attributes](https://stitcher.io/blog/attributes-in-php-8), [Enums](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-enums) and many others cool things.


### Open Swoole server ⚡️
Server part based on [Open Swoole](https://openswoole.com/docs). 
<br>High-performance server, async queue and scheduled (cron) jobs? `nyxio` has this.


### Just try it 🌈
...or join me and help create comfortable framework for developers.
